								<h4><em>Me: Sage O Ekpang</em></h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/MonoSagePictureFace.jpg" alt=""/></span>
								<p> I am Belgian/Nigerian and a speak both English and French (I would like to learn Dutch one day when I get better at my French). I love to learn and love experimenting with game mechanics using C++. What drives me is the thought of being the best I can be and being able to help those that need it regardless of the sitaution. I have recently been looking into graphical programming and I would love to become either a games programmer or graphical programmer depending on the journey I choose to take during my studies. </p>

								<h4><em>Staffordshire University</em></h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/bg2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> I am a current student at Staffordshire University Studying BSc (Hons) Computer Game Development. My aim is to leave and become a game developer or programmer for either an indie studio or AAA games company. If you would like to see some of my projects feel free to click on this link: <a href="#Portfolio">Portfolio</a>. As well as working at a well established games company or indie studio. I have taken an interest in graphics and graphical programming which I plan to explore during my time at University. </p>
						
								<h4><em>Passion for Technology</em></h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Code.png" alt="" /></span> <!-- Change image to code from carbon-->
								<p>Being a programmer, I have a passion for all things tech. I love looking for innovations and learning about how different technology can be intergrated together and the development of new tech to make interacted entertainment better. Software to do with Graphics are my favourite form of technology because I believe that pushing graphics to the limit can yield greate results</p>
								<p> Graphics have become a new passion of mine and learning about how they are evolving the games industry is very interesting. My inspiration for this comes from a youtuber called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague"> Sebastian Lague. </a> Looking at how he experiments with graphics and visual elements of software really inspired me and further inspired me to focus on graphical programming and development for games.</p>
								<p> I love different games and I am more drawn towards the FPS or third person shooter genre because of the flow of the gameplay and the games being great. My current favourite games are Overwatch and Valorant, they both offer similar but also completely different experiences and I love to play them with friends and also pick up on any key game design techniques they use such as the simple technique of enemies being red and alloies being blue. </p>

								<h4><em>Experiences</em></h4>
								<span class="image main"> <img src="images/Console.jpg" alt=""/></span>
								<p> I have extensive experience in multiple game engines as well as coding languages. Some to note are Unreal Engine, Unity, C++ and C#. You can refer to my <a href="#Portfolio">Portfolio</a> and <a href="#Skills">Skills</a> to learn more about my experience. </p>
								<p> I am also learning at a constant rate and improving the skills that I have been learning. I am constanly working and refining the programmatic skills I have learnt as well as develop skills that will make me a best fit for a game industrial environment. </p>

								<h4><em> Tank Turn Up </em></h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/sprite_13.png" alt="" /></span>
								<video class="image main" controls> <source src="videos/TankTurnUp.mp4"> </video>
								<p> <b> <a href="https://github.com/SageEkpang/TankTurnUp"> Link to Repo </a></b></p>
								<p> <b> Timeframe: </b> 3 Months </p>
								<p> <b> Software Used: </b> Unreal Engine 4 | AutoDesk Maya | Piskel </p>
								<p> <b> Role: </b> Game Developer </p>
								<p> <b> Skills: </b> C# | 3D Modelling | Animation | Pixel Art </p>
								<p> Tank Turn Up is a 3D platformer that was made in Unreal Engine 4 using Blueprints and Maya 3D modelling software. In this game you play as a tank and collect points whilst dodging different obstacles and accumulating a high score. This project was made for my FYP in college and it tested my skill with 3D modelling, the Unreal Engine Blueprint API and my Game Design knowledge. Overall I love making the game and further refinement would make the game even better. </p>
								
								<h4><em> Cat Rush </em></h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/CatRush.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p> <b> <a href="https://github.com/SageEkpang/CatRush"> Link to Repo </a></b></p>
								<p> <b> Timeframe: </b> 5 days </p>
								<p> <b> Software Used: </b> VS Code | Raylib | Piskel </p>
								<p> <b> Role: </b> Game Programmer </p>
								<p> <b> Skills: </b> C++ | Pixel Art </p>
								<p> Cat Rush is a 2D game that was made using a graphical 2D coding library called <a href="#"> Raylib.</a> This game was made with C++ and VS Code. This was a mini project that I used to test my knowledge on C++ and creating functionality for a game. I have done multiple mini projects however this is one of the most recent ones I have done.</p>
								<p> Within the game you play as a cat that has to rush to collect the different food items within the level. Once all the food items are collected, the level resets and you have to collect less food items than before however the time has gone down so you need to race against the time to make sure that cat does not perish!.</p>

								<h4><em> Marble Madness </em></h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/MarbleMadness.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p> <b> <a href="https://github.com/SageEkpang/MarbleMadness"> Link to Repo </a></b></p>
								<p> <b> Timeframe: </b> 6 Weeks </p>
								<p> <b> Software Used: </b> Unity Game Engine | Visual Studios</p>
								<p> <b> Role: </b> Game Developer </p>
								<p> <b> Skills: </b> C# | Pixel Art </p>
								<p> Marble Madness is a 3D Marble game made in Unity game engine. The main premise of the game is to collect points, get over the obstacles and get to the goal located at the end of the level. Each level gets harder than the last and you need to use what you have learnt from previous levels to beat the last one (Which is very hard in my opinion), however, it is possible to finish the game in a good time. I created this as one of my projects for an assignment in University. We were given a framework and we had to adapt to suit how we visualised it. </p>
							
								<h4><em> Back-Track (Game Jam) </em></h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/SplashArt.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p> <b> <a href="https://github.com/Daniel-D-Neumann/Global-Games-Jam/blob/main/Upload.zip"> Link to Repo </a></b></p>
								<p> <b> Timeframe: </b> 2 Days </p>
								<p> <b> Software Used: </b> Unity Game Engine | Piskel, Visual Studio </p>
								<p> <b> Role: </b> 2D Pixel Artist </p>
								<p> <b> Skills: </b> Pixel Art </p>
								<p> Back-Track is a 2D Pixel Art puzzle game where the player has to traverse different levels and complete different challenges to progress. You play as a small grandfather clock character with the ability to clone its self into a stopwatch character with parallel movement. You must find ways of using the clone and the original to beat these challenges. As well as this, you are able to "Back Track" by using an ability that allows you to swap yourself with a clone you create.</p>
								<p> This game was created as part of the Global Game Jam event that me and two other of my friends had participated in. I had decided to take on the art as I was one of the best equipped for the job. The jam was a very fun experience that I would recommend everyone try at least one as it allows you to have fun and work within a team and do roles you are suited to do and want to do.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Skills</h2>

								<h4><em> Soft Skills </em></h4>
								<ul class="icons"> 
									<li.a><strong> Communication: </strong><a class="icon solid fa-comments"></a></li.a>
										<p> During my years of game creation and development, I have had excellent communication skills with my team, work and leader. I am able to bring up necessary concerns about the project if needed and communicate ideas for game concepts. I can also get others to communicate so that the team can flow. </p>
									<li.a><strong> Teamwork: </strong><a class="icon solid fa-user-friends"></a></li.a>
										<p> Working in a team allows for opportunities to learn from others and see the strengths others have and the improvements that they are making. I can work within a team or be indepdendant depending on what the project requires. However, in both instances, I will always work to the best of my ability. </p>
									<li.a><strong> Time Management: </strong><a class="icon solid fa-clock"></a></li.a>
										<p> For any and every project I have worked on, I have made a time dedicated routine and it has helped me with getting work done, managing my off time and stay on top of work. I also take the time to help others if needed and help them manage their time as well to better help the team and themselves. </p>
								</ul>

								<h4><em> Software & Code </em></h4>
								<ul class="icons">
									<li.a><strong> C++ Programming: </strong><a class="icon solid fa-code"></a></li.a>
										<p> I have extensive knowledge in C++. I have been using the programming language for a year and a half now. I know majority about the language which is evident from my portfolio and the projects held there. I can not only use C++ for game development in an engine but for coding within a 2D coding library which requires a lot of manual coding to get the programs to work. </p> 
										<p> I have also learned the fundamentals of problem solving using this coding language and because it is infamously known as one of the hardest coding languages, I believe that it well equips me for problem solving in any space. My primary focus when using this coding language is it's class creation and OOP (Object Orientated Programming) functionality as this makes developing programs and games easier then some other software I have used in the past. </p>
									<li.a><strong> C# Programming: </strong><a class="icon solid fa-code"></a></li.a>
										<p> I have less experience in C# than C++ however I am still proficient in this coding language in Unity. I can do the majoirty of what an average game programmer can do, however I am still learning the software and I am developing my skills within it to work in industry. I will also work on programming C# for the terminal to further enhance my knowledge. </p> 
								</ul>

								<h4><em> Art </em></h4>
								<ul class="icons">
									<li.a><strong> Pixel Art: </strong><a class="icon solid fa-chess-board"></a></li.a>
										<p> I have been drawing Pixel Art for many years now and I have a good knowledge of how to create concepts and artwork in pixel art. I have made many 2D games using a 2D graphical library called <a href="https://www.raylib.com/"> Raylib.</a> I used this library to test my coding skills as well as skills in class creation within C++. If you would like to view some of my art, feel free to go to my instagram. <a href="#Socials"> Socials </a></p>
									<li.a><strong> Traditional Art: </strong><a class="icon solid fa-pencil-alt"></a></li.a>
										<p> I have an average knowledge in traditiona art. I have done some traditional art in the past and it has helped me understand some concepts to do with art such as composition, framing, colour theory, colour grading, etc. I am, however, no expert in this field. </p>
									<li.a><strong> Concept Art: </strong><a class="icon solid fa-palette"></a></li.a>
										<p> I have an average to intermediate knowledge of concept art as I had taken the role of a concept artist in group projects. I have my own artstyle and I am able to convey the ideas and concepts I have created with sketches that I had created for the subject or game. </p>
